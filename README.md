## 🎯 About My Portfolio

My portfolio is organized to demonstrate comprehensive testing knowledge from fundamental concepts to production-ready implementations. Each project serves a specific purpose in showcasing different aspects of QA automation:

### 📚 Portfolio Structure

#### **Fundamental Projects**
Projects focusing on core testing concepts and essential patterns:
- **[basic-api-testing](https://github.com/tyraelw/basic-api-testing)** - Core API testing patterns with GET/POST requests
- **[saucedemo-basic-tests](https://github.com/tyraelw/saucedemo-basic-tests)** - Essential Cypress commands and selectors

#### **Intermediate Projects** 
Projects demonstrating advanced patterns and techniques:
- **[api-intermediate-testing](https://github.com/tyraelw/api-intermediate-testing)** - Complete CRUD operations with variable chaining
- **[saucedemo-intermediate-tests](https://github.com/tyraelw/saucedemo-intermediate-tests)** - Custom commands and data-driven testing

#### **Advanced Projects**
Production-ready implementations built during my intensive QA training:
- **[cypress-ecommerce-testing](https://github.com/tyraelw/cypress-ecommerce-testing)** - Complete E2E suite with Page Object Model, CI/CD, and component testing
- **[trello-api-testing](https://github.com/tyraelw/trello-api-testing)** - Professional API testing with Newman CLI, authentication, and comprehensive workflows
- **[simple-grocery-store-api-testing](https://github.com/tyraelw/simple-grocery-store-api-testing)** - E-commerce flow automation with order management

### 🎓 My QA Journey

I completed an intensive 4-month QA automation course (2024) where I built comprehensive testing frameworks and learned industry best practices. After completing my training, I organized my portfolio to demonstrate not only advanced implementations but also my understanding of fundamental concepts that underpin those complex patterns.

**Why this structure?**
- Shows comprehensive understanding at all levels
- Demonstrates ability to explain concepts clearly
- Proves I didn't just follow tutorials—I understand the fundamentals
- Helps others learn from my organized progression
